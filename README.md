# ManualADTReduction

A python script that converts ADT list SMT queries in Negative Normal Form(NNF) to EUF SMT queries. The queries are represented using Python tuples, but there is a helper function to parse these tuples and turn them into SMT2 queries.

This reduction can be generalized to all possible ADT queries not necessarily in NNF form
